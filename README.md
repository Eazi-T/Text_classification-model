Text Classification Model for News Categorization
This project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a text classification model for news categorization. With a large influx of news articles daily, manual categorization is inefficient. Automating this process using NLP ensures scalability, accuracy, and consistency.

## Objective
Develop an NLP-powered machine learning model that categorizes news articles into predefined categories such as Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment, and Health. This project covers the complete NLP pipeline, including preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- Explore feature extraction methods such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.
- Learn to use NLP libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face Transformers.
- Experiment with NLP-specific models such as LSTM, BERT, or other transformer-based models.
- Gain experience in deploying NLP models via APIs.
